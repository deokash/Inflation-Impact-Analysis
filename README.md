# Inflation-Impact-Analysis using Python ðŸ’µ
###Objective
The objective of this analysis is to determine the extent to which inflation rates in India and the United States influence the INR/USD exchange rate over time. 

- Identify the correlation between inflation rates and the exchange rate, considering potential lag effects.
* Analyze whether the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) theory holds by comparing the actual exchange rate with the expected exchange rate based on inflation differentials.
+ Explore any deviations from the expected PPP-based exchange rate to uncover other economic factors that may contribute to exchange rate fluctuations.
